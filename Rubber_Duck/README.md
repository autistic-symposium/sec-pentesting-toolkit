The Duck
---------

The duck usb consist of a 60 MHz 32-bit CPU under the form of a USB stick. The input
is given by a loaded Micro SD storage.

The hacking consists in:

1) Download the payload (a bin file) in the micro SD storage (from your computer). Many payloads are available here, and other can be composed [here](http://ducktoolkit-411.rhcloud.com/Home.jsp).

2) Plug the micro SD into the USB-CPU.

3) Insert the USB in the computer to be hacked.

4) When you see the command prompt window be closed, you may remove the stick.

Quack!!!!
