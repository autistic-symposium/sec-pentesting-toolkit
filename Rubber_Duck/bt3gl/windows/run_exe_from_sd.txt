The following is a payload I have been working on that waits until a drive labeled "DUCKY" is mounted. I have used some of midnightsnake's code in this payload. The name of the file that is run can be changed to .exe, I am just having it run a batch for testing purposes. The line that says "STRING START %myd%\myEXE.bat" is the line that executes the executable.

The following is the batch file that is run after the "DUCKY" drive has been mounted. Everything is being run invisibly, so you will need to check for the existence of "Message.txt" which will probably be in "C:\Windows\system32".

REM Message.txt
echo Hello Wolrd!!!
echo Hello World!!! > Message.txt
The encoders now support the repeat command, so should only be a problem if you are using an old encoder. Encoders also now support white space in the duck script, so functions have been separated with white space.

The following is a newer version of the RunEXE from SD payload which uses googleknowsbest's method for finding the "DUCKY" drive, which is more portable than the previous version's method. This version should work on all current Windows versions. Ex... XP, Vista, and Windows 7.
