Running gdb in emacs

  M-x gdb
  C-h m to see the features of GDB mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://dirac.org/linux/gdb/04-Breakpoints_And_Watchpoints.php

Syntax of display and watch are like that for print.  If you can
print, then you can display or watch.  Note that gdb may refuse to
watch registers before the program is running, so set the watchpoints
after you break.  Here is an example of setting a watchpoint in a
loop, first to watch every change to the loop variable, and then to
check a particular value.

olive x> gdb a.out
...
(gdb) disas main
...
0x08048385 <main+17>:   movl   $0x0,-0x8(%ebp)
0x0804838c <main+24>:   jmp    0x8048392 <main+30>
0x0804838e <main+26>:   addl   $0x1,-0x8(%ebp)
0x08048392 <main+30>:   cmpl   $0x31,-0x8(%ebp)
0x08048396 <main+34>:   jle    0x804838e <main+26>
...
(gdb) b *0x08048385
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/jriely/class/373/x/a.out
...
(gdb) watch *((int*)($ebp-0x8))
Watchpoint 2: *(int *) ($ebp - 8)
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Watchpoint 2: *(int *) ($ebp - 8)

Old value = -1208435264
New value = 0
...
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Watchpoint 2: *(int *) ($ebp - 8)

Old value = 0
New value = 1
...
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Watchpoint 2: *(int *) ($ebp - 8)

Old value = 1
New value = 2
...

(gdb) disable 2
(gdb) watch *((int*)($ebp-0x8)) == 42
Watchpoint 3: *(int *) ($ebp - 8) == 42
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Watchpoint 3: *(int *) ($ebp - 8) == 42

Old value = 0
New value = 1
...
(gdb) p *(int *) ($ebp - 8)
$1 = 42

--------------------------------------------------------------------

When gdb is watching registers, it will watch those registers in all
code, which may not be what you want.

You can also condition a breakpoint, so that a particular breakpoint
will interrupt only if certain values are in place when the breakpoint
is reached.

Here is an example of breakpointing a loop that contains a function
call (in this code, if you simply try to watch $ebx, then the code for
printf will also trigger the breakpoint):

(gdb) disas
...
0x080483c0 <main+64>:   mov    %ebx,0x4(%esp)
0x080483c4 <main+68>:   add    $0x1,%ebx
0x080483c7 <main+71>:   movl   $0x80484b0,(%esp)
0x080483ce <main+78>:   call   0x80482d8 <printf@plt>
0x080483d3 <main+83>:   cmp    $0x32,%ebx
0x080483d6 <main+86>:   jne    0x80483c0 <main+64>
...
(gdb) b *0x080483d3
Breakpoint 3 at 0x80483d3
(gdb) condition 3 $ebx==42
(gdb) c
...
Breakpoint 3, 0x080483d3 in main ()
(gdb) p $ebx
$1 = 42
