# Recon


### Searching the Internets

The recon problems usually give you someone/something's name and a task or a hint to find some specific information about it. So the first thing is of course google it.

Google anything using keywords such as ```filetype:cgi inurl:cgi-bin```


### In addition we can look at:

- Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google+, reddit,  /r/netsec.
- IRC: with **/whois **.
